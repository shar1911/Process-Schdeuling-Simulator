# Process-Schdeuling-Simulator
The CPU Scheduler Simulation project is a desktop application designed to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms. Developed using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, this tool provides a hands-on approach to understanding how different scheduling algorithms manage processes in an operating system.
